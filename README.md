# C#--board-game
2 player console board game for connect 4/checker 

## Overview
The objective of this project is to gain practical experience with object-oriented software development through object modelling with design diagrams and applying standard software design principles and patterns. This understanding is to be demonstrated by creating and documenting an object-oriented design and implement it using C# for a larger real-world motivated problem.

## Description

Provide a reusable framework for two-player board games. To demonstrate that your framework can be easily adapted to different games, your design must accommodate all the following games in the same software:
- Connect Four aka Four in a Row. Two players take turns dropping pieces on a 7x6 board. The player forms an unbroken chain of four pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. (Wikipedia)
- Checkers aka Draughts. Two players take turns moving pieces diagonally and mandatorily capturing by jumping over opponent pieces on a 8x8 board. The player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game. (Wikipedia)
